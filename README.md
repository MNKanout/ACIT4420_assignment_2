## Experience Report

### Challenges Faced

- **Error Handling:** Implementing error handling for each module was crucial but challenging at first. Ensuring meaningful error messages for invalid inputs took some time to consider.

- **Module Integration:** Merging different modules and ensuring they worked cohesively required careful planning, particularly in managing the contacts and sending messages.

- **Testing:** Writing unit tests to cover all possible scenarios (especially error scenarios) helped reinforce understanding of the modules' functionalities but required extensive attention to detail to ensure all edge cases were considered.
